File 1: anomaly_data.py # generates feature vectors from data
File 2: anomaly_train.py # Finds optimal nu and gamma. Also, generates roc_values.txt file.
File 3: severity_score_batch_generator.py
	Input to file 3: Best value corresponding to recall and auc score, usually the top value in roc_values.txt.
	If better more balanced high scores are available across precision, recall, accuracy and auc, choose the corresponding threshold.  
	# Generates batches of data: 1. Batches of size 100(default) in folder features_rbf_batch and 2. Batches of data per second in folder features_rbf_per_sec
	
File 4: Main.py, execute it to get interface which gives malicious trades and malicious traders. 
	Arguments: no of trades to observe per cluster (default = 5)
		 : no of analysts (default = 5)
		 : severity threshold (default = 5)
		 : mini batches to be left out (default = 0) # If the last mini batch has no. of tuples < no of analysts, it raises a warning.
							       To not take that mini batch into account, give '1' as argument
	Note*: no of trades to observe per cluster*no of analysts < batch_size of mini batch
		For eg. Since mini batch size is 100, no of analysts(<=10) and no of trades to observe per cluster(<=10)
